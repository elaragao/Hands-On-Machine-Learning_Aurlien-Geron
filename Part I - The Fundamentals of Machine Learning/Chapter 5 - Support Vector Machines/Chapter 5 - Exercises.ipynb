This dataset contains the chemical analyses of 178 wine samples produced by 3 different cultivators: the goal is to train a classification model capable of predicting the cultivator based on the wine’s chemical analysis. Since SVM classifiers are binary classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-all to classify all three classes. What accuracy can you reach?"

You can use the original dataset rather than the tweaked version we used in Chapter 2, which you can load using sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing(). The targets represent hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since there are over 20,000 instances, SVMs can be slow, so for hyperparameter tuning you should use far fewer instances (e.g., 2,000) to test many more hyperparameter combinations. What is your best model’s RMSE?"
