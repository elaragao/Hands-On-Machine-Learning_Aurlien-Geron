    "## 10. The classic Olivetti faces dataset contains 400 grayscale 64 × 64–pixel images of faces. Each image is flattened to a 1D vector of size 4,096. Forty different people were photographed (10 times each), and the usual task is to train a model that can predict which person is represented in each picture. Load the dataset using the sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces() function, then split it into a training set, a validation set, and a test set (note that the dataset is already scaled between 0 and 1). Since the dataset is quite small, you will probably want to use stratified sampling to ensure that there are the same number of images per person in each set. Next, cluster the images using k-means, and ensure that you have a good number of clusters (using one of the techniques discussed in this chapter). Visualize the clusters: do you see similar faces in each cluster?"

Next, use k-means as a dimensionality reduction tool, and train a classifier on the reduced set. Search for the number of clusters that allows the classifier to get the best performance: what performance can you reach? What if you append the features from the reduced set to the original features (again, searching for the best number of clusters)?"

    "## 12. Train a Gaussian mixture model on the Olivetti faces dataset. To speed up the algorithm, you should probably reduce the dataset’s dimensionality (e.g., use PCA, preserving 99% of the variance). Use the model to generate some new faces (using the sample() method), and visualize them (if you used PCA, you will need to use its inverse_transform() method). Try to modify some images (e.g., rotate, flip, darken) and see if the model can detect the anomalies (i.e., compare the output of the score_samples() method for normal images and for anomalies)."

If you plot a reconstructed image, you will see why: it tries to reconstruct a normal face."
