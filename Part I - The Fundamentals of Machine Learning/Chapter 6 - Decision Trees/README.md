# Decision Trees

Decision trees are capable of performing both classification and regression, as well as multi-output tasks. They are capable of handling complex datasets.

The chapter will briefly discuss their functionality, how to train them, and how to visualize the predictions made.

# Training and Visualizing a Decision Tree

The .ipybn file will demonstrate how the decision tree operates on the `load_iris` dataset, using the `DecisioTreeClassifier` class. The output can be viewed using the `export_graphviz` class.
